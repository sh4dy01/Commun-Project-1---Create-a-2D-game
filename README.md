# Kitty's Bizarre Adventure
## Overview
This game marks the culmination of my first year at the Gaming Tech School. 
In this interdisciplinary project, our team of 11 students formed a MINI STUDIO and embarked on the creation of our first 2D game. 
Adhering to specific constraints, such as an 11-day development cycle (including brainstorming), an isometric view, and an amusement park theme, we utilized the Phaser Framework.
